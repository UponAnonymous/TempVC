TempVC manages and customizes temporary rooms (and more) in your Discord server with a streamlined, neutral branding.

## Invite
Unfortunately, hosting does not grow on trees... and TempVC has always been **FREE** for everyone.

For this reason the public instance of TempVC is now **offline**.

The documentation will still be kept online, so if you want you can still follow the [guide](https://mgd.starless.dev/selfhosting/) to setup your own instance of the bot.

## Features
- Support for **temporary** and **pinned** (aka *permanent*) rooms
- Room customization:
  - Name
  - Capacity
  - Whitelist and blacklist users
  - Kick users
- Support for multiple categories
- Filters: do not let users use offensive names for their rooms
- Manage all the rooms easily in a single dashboard
- Fully translatable: currently only available in English and Italian
- and more...

## Documentation
All of the documentation, invite link and uptime information is available on the new site <a href="https://mgd.starless.dev" target="_blank">https://maggiordomo.starless.dev</a>.
